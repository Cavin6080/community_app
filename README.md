# Community Management System

### Inspiration
- The idea came from HackThisFall's 3.0 Event. We thought about this event & planned to create a system for the same. The  primary goal is to connect Community Organisers with Attendees / Learners, Venue & Sponsors.

### Tech Stack
- Flutter & Dart for Mobile App
- Appwrite for Backend
- Directus.io (Headless CMS) implemented this to easily acheive Role Management.
- Node.js to integrate ApyHub with App.
- Pagemaker.io (Landing Page Builder)

### What we have acheived so far

- We have implemented Auth Module, A Dashboard Page & Base UI for Event Section

### Features have planned to develop in near future
- Manage Communities
- Manage Events & Attendees
- Manage Sponsors & venue Partners
- Share Events to various Social Platforms via Share Intents
- Provide opprtunities for students / professionals to connect with community mentors & certified professionals. 
- Integrate AR to recognise Face of Attendee & show Social Profiles using AR.

### What we have learned while planning / developing project during HackThisFall 3.0 Hackathon

- Explored Appwrite Auth & DB to manage all our Basic Operations on Appwrite.
- We explored a Haedless CMS Platform called Directus (https://directus.io). A No-code tool to manage Backend, Web Panels & roles for the diffrent users.

### Challenges we faced while developing

- Faced some challenging issues while implementing Directus in Flutter App using an un-official Dart Package
- We have also tried diretcly fething records from Endpoint URL mentioned in Directus but unfortunately haven't able to manage it & chose Appwrite for Backend.

### Which of services we have used which were provided by the sponsors of the event
- Used Appwrite for Auth & other API used in App
